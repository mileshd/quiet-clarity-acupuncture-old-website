<div id="quote" style="width: 180px;">&quot;The best doctor gives the least medicines.&quot; <br />
  - Benjamin Franklin</div>
 <blockquote>&quot;The Spirit tends towards purity, but the mind disturbs it.&quot; - Lao-tzu</blockquote>
 <br />
<p>I became a patient of acupuncture 20 years ago. The experience opened my eyes to a different way of healing. I studied and graduated from <a href="http://www.tai.edu">TAI Sophia </a>(formerly know as the Traditional Acupuncture Institute), in Laurel Maryland where I received a Masterâ€™s  of Acupuncture degree. I studied with JR Worsley at the College of Traditional Acupuncture in the UK.</p>
<p>I am licensed in the state of Maryland and recognized by major health insurers as a provider of acupuncture. I was a member of the TAI clinical faculty for 5 years, and helped pioneer an acupuncture treatment program for people recovering from drug addiction in Baltimore.</p>
<p>I have studied Zero Balancing since 1993 and was certified in 1995. In addition to my practice, I am also a mentor, assisting ZB candidates in the certification process.</p>
<p>I am a clinical faculty member of <a href="http://www.ongiaracollege.ca">Ongiara College of Acupuncture and Moxibustion</a> since its inception.</p>
<p>I have studied Five Element acupuncture extensively with Niki Bilton since 1999 to deepen my understanding of this system of healing. I am a devoted teacher and practitioner of Five Element principles. I combine my formal educational training with a strong spiritual practice.</p>
