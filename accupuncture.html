  - Chinese   saying</div>
  <p>Traditional acupuncture, proven effective over thousands of years, is directed toward good health, vitality, balance, longevity, and alleviation of stress. Even though Chinese medicine and Western medicine are different, they complement each other. Acupuncture is an ancient approach addressing modern concerns, effective in a wide range of complaints.</p>
<p>It is likely that more people have been treated by Chinese medicine throughout history than by any other formalized system of medicine. This model of medical practice, which is an art as well as a science, is based on natural laws describing the 
movement of life energy in nature and the body.</p>        
	<p>This life energy, called <span style=" font-style: italic;">qi (pronounced chee)</span>, courses through the body in channels similar to rivers that course through the earth. When the <span style=" font-style: italic;">qi</span> in the body is full and moving properly, health is promoted. When the <span style=" font-style: italic;">qi</span> is  disharmonious, disease can begin. Even everyday stresses like deadlines and disappointments can disrupt the harmonious movement of <span style=" font-style: italic;">qi</span>. Hence stresses compounded over time can lead to symptoms later. Traditional acupuncture treats the underlying imbalances rather than only the most obvious symptoms. In addition, treatment now can prevent symptoms later. Acupuncture enhances health and promotes the capacity of a person to heal naturally.
</p>
<p>Traditional Five Element acupuncture is often effective for people of all ages and with a wide range of conditions. Acupuncture is helpful for many severe chronic illnesses, complaints that have no easily determined cause, and for nagging chronic conditions as well. You can find a list of more specific ailments treated on the <a href="conditions.html">Conditions Treated</a> page.
	With ongoing treatment for maintenance and health promotion, you will notice that:
<ul style=" list-style-type: disc; text-indent: 20px;">
	<li>you will get sick less often and recover more quickly;</li>
	<li>your vitality and stamina will improve;</li>
	<li>you will be more able to take care of your own health;</li>
	<li>your relationships with others may deepen and become  harmonious;</li>
	<li style="text-indent: 20px;">health problems other than those for which you entered treatment are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to clear up;</li>
	<li>you will have reductions in long-term health care costs.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>While acupuncture is concerned with the whole person and addresses itself to many levels of functioning, it is also a particular form of treatment with its own limitations.</p>
      <p>It is often the case that if you are already being cared for by another health care provider, you will need to remain in his or her care. Acupuncture is a complement to other modalities of care. It is not recommended to alter medications or other therapies without consulting with your personal physician or provider.</p>
