  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="1">Is acupuncture covered by insurance?</a></h3>
  <p>More and more insurance companies are covering acupuncture treatment. I will be happy to discuss this further with you if you call my office.
</p>
  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="2">How long will I be in treatment?</a></h3>
  <p>Acupuncture treatment is a process because it treats the root of the  problem. Symptoms that have been around longer will take longer to clear. Therefore, conditions that have arisen over many years may be relieved  with slow, steady progress. When there is significant improvement, treatments can be spaced out to every other week, monthly and seasonally. Frequency of treatment varies with each individual.
</p>
  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="3">Does it hurt?</a></h3>
  <p>Acupuncture needles are single-use sterile needles. The needles are extremely fine,  barely beyond the thickness of a human hair. The needles are a fraction of the size of a hypodermic needle. They are so thin, clients rarely feel them entering the skin. When the needle connects with an acupuncture point,  there may be a brief sensation of heat, buzzing or pressure, at the site, or another part of the body.
</p>
  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="4">Should I tell my doctor?</a></h3>
  <p>Yes, tell your doctor that you are in acupuncture treatment. Today, most doctors recognize the potential benefits of acupuncture and many refer their patients for treatment. Acupuncture is a complement to western medical care. All medications need to stay the same, unless you and your doctor agree to shift them.
</p>
  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="5">Are there any side effects of acupuncture?</a></h3>
  <p>There are no known side effects of acupuncture.</p>
  <h3><a style="color: #544119; text-decoration:none;" name="6">What if I don't have anything "wrong" with me?</a></h3>
  <p>You don't have to feel sick to receive benefits from acupuncture treatment. People often come who want to further their own personal growth. Some choose acupuncture in times of major life transitions, such as job changes, divorce, or death of a loved one.</p>
