<blockquote style=" font-style: italic;">"Zero Balancing promotes quieting and centering of the body/mind, much as meditation might do for the skilled meditator. With the blending of Eastern wisdom with Western science, this process not only helps to relieve physical and mental pain, but also helps to improve the effectiveness, quality and joy of daily life."<br /><br /><span style="text-align: right;"> -Glenn Rothfeld, M.D., M.Ac.<br />Holistic Healthcare Physician</span></blockquote>

<p>Zero Balancing (ZB) is a hands-on bodywork system designed to align your energy body with your physical structure. Simple yet powerful, it focuses on your whole person, even when addressing specific needs. The Zero Balancing process generally takes between 30 and 40 minutes and is performed when you are fully clothed. It was developed by Fritz Smith, M.D. in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>People in any number of situations can benefit from Zero Balancing -- from the person under pressure or having stress-related symptoms to the well person who wishes to maintain optimal health or is on a journey of self-discovery and self-actualization. ZB is holistic because it deals with energy and energy fields directly, as well as with body structure. The balancing processes often release stress before it becomes physically manifested.</p>
<p>The number and frequency of sessions you receive  depends on the reason why you are seeking Zero Balancing. A minimum of three sessions is recommended, however, since each session builds on the last. Maintenance sessions, if needed, should be at intervals of every two to four months.</p>
